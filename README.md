# Chat-app
Production ready chat application

This was a personal project to learn Web Socket usage through Socket.io

No authentication required, no external API's used.

Included chat rooms and usernames with validation to ensure there's no duplicates. Added auto scrolling features and user lists for each individual room. 

You can test the finalized version by visiting the following link:

As long as you use the same chat room, you can chat with as many people as you'd like.
